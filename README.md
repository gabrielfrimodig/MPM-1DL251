# Exam notes
The topics of the exam will be:
* *Software Processes* (Lecture 1)
* *Requirements Engineering* (Lecture 2)
* *Architectural Design* (Lecutre 4)
* *Inspection* (Lecture 6, aka "Maintenance")
* *Group dynamics* (Lecture 9, aka "Project management")

## Lecture 1 & 2
* Define software engineering, explain the engineering view on SE and what are the relevant constrains.
* Define the concept of process-based quality. Explain the advantages and disadvantages.
* List the 4 metrics used to measure the quality of a product, explain how we can actually measure them using a process.
* Identify the differences between plan driven and incremental processes.
* Describe, sketch a working diagram and explain both, when and how, the 4 main software process activities are done on the following processes. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each one:
    * Waterfall model
    * V-Model
    * Incremental development
    * Reuse-based development
* Define user requirements.
* Define system requirements. Compare user requirements and system requirements in terms of what they describe, how they are created and how they are used.
* Define functional requirements.
* Define non-functional requirements. Compare functional requirements and non-functional requirements in terms of what they describe and how they are used.
* Formulate functional and non-functional requirements from a brief description of a product.
* Describe, sketch a working diagram of the spiral view of process, emphasising the actors responsible for each process and their main responsabilities.
* Define requirements elicitation, explain its use in the software engineering process and the role of all actors involved. 
* Define requirements specification, explain its use in the software engineering process and the role of all actors involved. 
* Formulate a well structured user stories as a use case using the natural language and UML.
* Define requirements validation, explain its use in the software engineering process and the role of all actors involved. 
* Define requirements verification, explain its use in the software engineering process and the role of all actors involved. 
* List the desired characteristics of system requirements. Explain how we can actually measure them.
* Compare user stories and tasks in agile methodologies.

## Lecture 4
* Define software design.
* Define system design. Compare software design and system design in terms of how the programs are composed.
* Describe the model for design process. Explain the function of the following activities in the context of software specification: design inputs, design activities, design outputs.
* Describe, sketch a working diagram and classify the architectural patterns as physical vs. logical. Compare the advantages and disadvantages between systems:
    * Client-server
    * Master-slave
    * Distributed component
    * Layered model
    * Model-view-controller
* Describe the N-tier architectural model. Explain the differences between a thin and fat client version. 

## Lecture 6
* Define code reviews. Explain why they are an important inspection tool.
* Describe and classify the following review processes based on how formal they are. Compare the advantages and disadvantages between processes:
    * Pair programming
    * Over-the-shoulder
    * Peer review
    * Pre-checking
    * Formal meeting
* Describe how the inspection process works. Explain what are different activities and who is responsible for them before, during and after the meeting. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the process.
* Define the concept of legacy system.
* Enumerate the two key metrics we use to decide if to scrap, keep or refactor legacy systems.
* Describe and sketch a diagram how the two metrics are used to inform the decision of scraping, keeping or refactoring legacy systems.

## Lecture 9
* Define cost model.
* Explain what are the aspects that can influence the development cost of a product in the following models:
    * Budget-limited model
    * Plan-based model
    * Algorithmic cost models
* Define group dynamics and why they are important for project management.
* Describe the Tuckman's stages of group development and sketch a working diagram emphasising how we can influence each stage.
* Describe the GRIP model.
* Assess and compare how a development team is performing using group dynamics theories.
* Evaluate your own group's hazards, strengths, weakness and performance using group dynamics theories.
